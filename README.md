# Satellite-Image-Segmentation

  A prototype system for semantic segmentation of Satellite Images. In the Window's operating system, the size of the executable file is 700M, model parameters are 40M, and the computation cost is 266 in GFLOPS.
  
## Introduction
  The Adaptive Feature Aggregation (AFA) layer for multi-task CNNs, in which a dynamic aggregation mechanism is designed to allow each task adaptively determines the degree to which the feature aggregation of different tasks is needed. We introduce two types of aggregation modules to the AFA layer, which realize the adaptive feature aggregation by capturing the feature dependencies along the channel and spatial axes, respectively.   
  
## Models
  * `/models/layer_afa.py`: implementation of afa layer;
  * `/models/net_image_resnet.py`: single task network based resnet50;   
  * `/models/net_image_afalayer.py`: image tasks aggregation with afa layer;   
  * `/models/net_pixel_deeplab.py`: single task network based deeplab;   
  * `/models/net_pixel_afalayer.py`: pixel tasks aggregation with afa layer;   
  
## Requirements  

  Python >= 3.6  
  numpy  
  PyTorch >= 1.0  
  torchvision  
  tensorboardX
  

## Installation
  1. Clone the repo:   
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/zhenshen-mla/AFANet.git   
    ```   
    ```
    cd AFANet
    ```
  2. For custom dependencies:   
    ```
    pip install matplotlib tensorboardX   
    ```
## For Training   
  1. Download the dataset([NYUv2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html), [Adience benckmark](https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html#frontalized)) and configure the data path.   
  2. Train the single-task and save the pretrained single-task model in `/weights`:   
  3. For pixel tasks, using Deeplabv3+ network with ResNet backbone to conduct semantic segmentation and depth prediction. For image tasks, using ResNet network to conduct age prediction and gender classification (load pretrained model in `/weights`):
